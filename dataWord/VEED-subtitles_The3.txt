Oh. Mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm.

Okay, here we go.

Here we go. Uh…

Hey, world.

I'm Teddy Jackson,
and I wanna welcome you to Teddybands.

Ha-ha!

All right, listen,
weights are about to be no more.

It's all about the bands.

Why? Because this is
where you get the best resistance.

You can stretch it,
do whatever you want with it.

The best thing is
to get you some reps in there though.

Get a lot of reps to where you feel it.

Shit, I felt it. Goddamn.

It's my eye. It got me
right on the side of the eye. Dammit.

One hundred.

What's up, world?

Teddy Jackson here,
welcoming you to Teddyburn,

where I'm introducing
two pieces of non-breathable plastic.

Think about five garbage bags
wrapped up into two good pieces,

where you just
can't let nothing out, except sweat.

Oh, man. Whoo!

I'm getting dizzy. Shit.

Wait. Fitness is…

Nah.

Hey, what's going on, guys?

Teddy Jackson here,
and I wanna introduce you to the Teddybar.

I already know what you're thinking.
"Teddy, what is it?"

I'll tell you exactly what it is.
It's an adjustable pull-up bar.

Why did I make it?

Because some pull-up bars
are just too high.

So this one adjusts to your comfort level.

That's right. Adjust it
to the right height and pull up all night.

Let's go!

Let's get it! Oh yeah!

Oh!

Oh shit! Lori!

God. Godda…

Aw, come on!

Lori, the…

- The Teddybar fell on my head! Goddamn it!
- Oh, Teddy.

It does it every time I'm taping.

You need to come up
with something a little less dangerous.

You may not talk to me,

but everybody talks to him.

I gotta say, it's a real honor.

Working on this guy
the last couple of days,

but he trained with
French special forces so he's tough as--

Shh.

Sorry, my, uh, wife's leftovers.

Before we begin I'd like
to tell you a little about myself.

I was raised by my grandfather

on a frozen lake 50 miles from nowhere.

He was a kind man.

He taught me many useful things.

One brisk afternoon,
while we were fishing on the frozen lake,

we saw a large form approaching.

It was a grizzly.

My grandfather yelled at me to run,

so I took off as fast
as my little legs would carry me.

And when I looked back,

I learned the last thing

that my unfortunate grandfather
would ever teach me.

Bears have very sharp claws,

which they use to fillet the skin
off their still-breathing victims.

I share this with you
because when you beg for your life,

I'm not gonna hear your screams.

Any feeling I once had dried up
on that frozen lake long ago.

You're wasting your time.

After I remove your eyes, your ears,

and balls, all your sensory organs,

if you still haven't told me
what I need to know…

-Please.
-…I'm going to fillet you

like that bear did my grandfather.

It's Grenkin! Velvel Grenkin.

275 Castro Street.

Velvel Grenkin, he's there, I swear.

I'm gonna tell
my grandkids of this, one day.

Or…

nobody

ever.

I like you.

Tell your wife wild juniper's the secret.

Not the store-bought.

It looks like bunny shit,
so better smell it first.

Who the hell was that?

No!

Good morning, Yorktown.

It's ten past eight
on a beautiful Monday morning.

None of my kids talk to me.
I don't know where they are.

Look who's up, huh?

Happy birthday.

What time is it?

I think it's, um…

I think it's baby-making time.

We can do it in that position
that don't even feel good.

It feels good for you.

-I'm saying, for me it's just more about…
-A baby?

…survival of the species.

-What?
-Mm-hmm.

I'm just trying to break it down to you.

I hear you.

But you know
you can't Teddy that one, right?

What… What does that mean, honey?

That's what they call it at the firm now.

If a paralegal screws up,
they say they Teddyed it.

They named a screw-up after me?

- You're actually a verb now.
- Okay, listen, that's the past.

Why talk about the past?
I wanna focus on the present.

Look at this.

Come on, look at it.

Onancock, Virginia?

I got us a little cabin for your birthday.

-Tons of baby-making time.
-Uh…

Baby, what is this? I can't read this.
There's no toner on the page.

It's the reservation, babe.

We leave tonight. It's perfect.

Thank you.

I'm not messing up
your birthdays anymore, babe.

On a serious note,

did you talk to Marty
about your business idea?

I did not talk to Marty yet,
but there's a reason.

-I'm just waiting for the right time.
-There's never gonna be a right time.

You just have to do it.

You're absolutely right.
Know what? I'm just gonna do it.

-I'm gonna pitch it to him today.
-Today?

He's gonna fall in love with it.
The money that'll come will be ridiculous.

I'm gonna pay our tax lien off.
I'm gonna fix this place up.

It's gonna happen.

You think maybe we could start
with some light bulbs and toner?

That's what Teddying it looks like, right?

-Mm-hmm.
-Okay, all right. I'll get the bulb.

And toner.

And the toner.

♪ Light the blunts up
When I walk in the building ♪

♪ Gravy getting buck
Every time I get up in it… ♪

- Morning.
- Teddy. Oh, I know. I know.

-I've been meaning to come by the gym.
-Well, you better come, Betty!

-There, I will.
-Dream hard and punch harder!

-Thanks.
-Here you go, guys.

-Marty's Fitness. Right up the street.
-Thanks.

Stop lunchin' and get to punchin'!

Non-contact boxing, Marty.

Non-contact boxing?

This is big.

This is the whole breakdown of the idea.

Now, the big thing here
is that it's still boxing,

without the contact.

That's the beauty of the idea.

Look at this. I'm getting that same burn
that I normally would, right?

But I don't touch you.

I got so excited
when I started to get into the idea,

I decided to put up
the first workout video.

Just to get a response.

Three comments.

And the questions are simple.
They're like, "What is this?"

This…

Digest it.

…could be the dumbest idea
I've ever heard.

Sales is not your forte.

I'll be honest you.
I don't know what that word means.

What are you… What are you saying?

-Let me show you something.
-Yeah, sure.

See these flyers you made up?

I spent my entire marketing budget
on these things,

and we ain't got one bite.

Marty, they're gonna come
through that door any day, any minute.

-You just gotta be patient. You know that.
-Well, they would be.

If you had put the address on this thing!

What?

-I mean, who really needs addresses?
-My customers.

Then they'll call you, Marty.

You left out the phone number too.

Dammit, did I?

Teddy, you're a nice guy. You really are.

But I need a dude with some grit.

I got grit.

Are you firing me?

I need a closer, Ted.

Non-contact boxing.

That's your closer, man.

I'm sorry, Ted.

Marty, I've worked hard on this.

So stupid.

Yes, ma'am?

Ready to go back to work?

The only thing I'm working on
is my breakfast.

Your breakfast can wait.

I've got a blue-chip client,

and he's got a red-hot stack
with a two-million-dollar fee.

With respect, I'm listening.

I thought so.

It's a two-phase extraction.

One million dollars for each one.

Payday like this comes along
once in a decade.

-Where?
-Onancock, Virginia.

7:00 p.m. Jump on it.

- Oh. Hey.
- Hey, there he is, my little avocado.

So, GPS says we'll be there by 6:00 p.m.
I am so excited.

Well, if that's the case,
I'll go get dressed now.

-Okay, sounds good. Yeah.
-All right?

Oh, hey.

-Hmm?
-How'd it go with Marty?

-How'd it go with Marty?
-Yeah.

-It was, uh… Yeah, it was great.
-Yeah?

He said it wasn't, like,
the dumbest thing he's ever heard, so.

-Great.
-Yeah.

-I'm proud of you.
-I'm proud of you too.

Hit me.

You're reconfirmed.

Payment on-site in cash
at completion of job.

Somebody will be waiting for you there.

It's house 1465.

Groovy.

Wait, a day spa?

-I thought we had a cabin.
-We do have a cabin.

I'm gonna go meet the guy at the cabin.
Before I do that I wanted to let you out

because I got you two hours at a spa.

Okay, Teddy Jackson, you are killing it.

-You like that?
-Yeah.

Babe, I got you set up
for the whole shebang.

-You're getting a facial, mani-pedi--
-I love it. Okay, I love it.

-Okay?
-Thank you.

You're welcome, honey.

Ah.

Lori,
I'm not gonna Teddy this one.

Got the magic box, let's go.

Come on.

Shit. Damn it.

This is nice.
This whole thing is nice, right here.

You're early.

Well, if you're on time, you're late.

Ain't that right?

Do me a favor, grab this box.
You know, I got bottles. Get the bottles.

Whoo!

My legs. You're big, ain't you?

Oh, this ain't bad. This ain't bad at all.

I'm glad I made it up here
before it got dark though.

That would've been something else.

Champagne?

That's to celebrate.

I'm gonna do a little bit of this,
a little bit of that.

This is… all part of your method?

No, man, this is just a warm-up.

When you ain't did it in a while,
things can get a little animal.

Yeah. You know what I'm talking about.

Gotta tap into that danger zone.
Start using safe words.

I can't say that I do.

Oh, you probably got safe sentences.
Safe paragraphs.

Where the bathroom at? I gotta pee, man.

Behind you.

Oh, shit.

Oh! Damn.

Whoo!

There it is.

I'm sorry if you can hear this.
I got a strong stream.

Been like this since I was six.

It's called "a consistent flow,"
that's what the doctor said. Phew.

A little above average for my size.

I'm at the tail end of it now, though.

Oh God.

Man, I'm surprised I made it this far.

I'm ready to get to work now though.

Well, follow me.

Oh, you gonna take me on the tour.

What is it, a game room?
You got a ping-pong table down here?

Probably… Hey, how are you doing?
You with the rental team?

Good to see you.

Oh, my. Hold on. What the…

-No.
-Uh-uh.

Excuse me.

We have work to do.
You're not leaving until it's done.

We…

We got work to do? Oh. Uh…

Mr. Coughlin,

allow me to introduce

the Man from Toronto.

What? Hold on. Wait a second.

The Man from Toronto?
Just give me… Give a second. Give me…

Hmm.

Wait, hold on.

Just hold on a second.

I know a guy that knows a guy
that saw you do this once.

Said it was life-changing.

And now I get to witness it firsthand.

Mm.

Unless, of course, he talks.

"Unless, of course, he talks."

He said, if he talks,

then things can be different.

Because you, you know who I am.

You know me.

You guys all…
Everybody here must know who I am.

Now, if you know what I know,
that's that I love to communicate.

So let's figure out the best way to talk.

Right?

-Please.
-I hope you understand what I'm saying.

Last I checked,
communication is key to understanding.

Is it muggy? Are you guys… Is it a little…

The air, right? Back up. Back up.

Put the hammer down and back up.
You're crowding me, okay?

And I can't do whatever it is
I'm here to do with you on my ass.

Now, what you need to know

is that…

I don't know what is going on.

I don't know what they want.

They called me the Man from Toronto.
I don't even know who that is.

- Give them what they want. Is it money?
- No.

He starts with the eyes.

You said what? I start…

You start with the eyes.

Hmm.

You're gonna listen.

I love eyes.

I would hate for your eyes
to be next on my activity list.

I don't wanna do this.

I don't like none of this.

I don't like nasty stuff.

I don't like blood.

They say he filleted
an entire poker parlor in Minnesota.

I… I did what in Minnesota?

Filleted the entire poker parlor.

Goddamn right I did.
Don't nobody else say anything.

You know why?
Because at this point I'm getting angry.

I'm getting angry,
and I'm about to get real active.

Look at my thumbs. Because
it's the last thing you're gonna see.

Look at this. Look at me, I'm gonna do it.

-Oh, God, no.
-What? Do you want me to do it?

No!

-Do you want me--
-No!

-I'm gonna do it!
-No.

Do you think I'm playing?

-I can't hear you! Is that what you want?
-Ah! No.

-Is that what you want? Then say it!
-No.

-Say it!
-Okay, I'll tell you!

Say it!

Okay, 4-4-5-0-8

12-53-C.

I'm sorry, please don't.
Please don't hurt me.

All right, stop it. Stop it.

-Let me get myself together.
-Please…

Let me get myself together.

Please. Don't hurt…

Is that… Is that what you needed?

- Hey. It's me.
- You saved our lives.

Yeah. Tell the colonel we got the codes.

And the Man from Toronto

is gonna continue on
to Washington, DC to meet.

Huh?

What's that?

FBI! Don't move!
